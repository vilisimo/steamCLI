-some of the games have price_in_cents (war of the roses)

steamapp tests:
- config -> change to mock objects
- mock.patch(steamCLI.steamapp.SteamApp...) -> mock.patch.object(SteamApp,
method)

- assertRaises: some tests add side effect to response.get directly, instead
of returning a mock object with an error inside

-_get_app_html and _fetch_text are basically the same, except for cookies.
Could merge them. But then caller would have to know a looooot when calling
various methods.

-a lot of private methods have config in it. Perhaps it would be better to
remove it, move those to optional arguments and have the caller deal with the
 logic. This way, methods would be a bit more general.
