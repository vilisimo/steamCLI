- some of the games have price_in_cents (war of the roses)

- review scraping and ITAD API calls could be made in parallel.

- maybe there should be a db that has all titles/app ids. It could be used to
look up the associated app id, title, then all three calls could be made in
parallel.

- sanitize_title() does not sanitize strings in a way that Is There Any Deal
expects. Namely, it does not represent, say, russian letters the itad does.
Unidecode csn be used to decode non-english strings, but that does not result in
identical strings that itad uses. There should be a way to query their API
through steam id?
